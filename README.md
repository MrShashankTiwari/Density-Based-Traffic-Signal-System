# Density-Based-Traffic-Signal-System

The project is aimed at designing a density based traffic signal system where the timing of signal will change automatically on sensing the traffic density at any junction.<br />
Traffic congestion is a major problem in most cities across the world and therefore it is time to make an automated system with decision making mechanism.<br />
Present day traffic signaling system is fixed time based which is not effective if one lane has more traffic than others. To fulfill this problem we have designed a concept of intelligent traffic control system.<br />
Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of the junction demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time.<br />
We, therefore propose a mechanism in which the time period of green light and red light is assigned on the basis of the density of the traffic present at that time. This is achieved by using Infrared sensors.<br />
Once the density is calculated, the glowing time of green light is assigned by the help of the microcontroller.<br />
The sensors which are present on sides of the road will detect the presence of the vehicles and sends the information to the microcontroller where it will decide how long a the signal lights will remain green.
